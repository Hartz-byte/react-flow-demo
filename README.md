# Flow Diagram Builder

This is a React application that allows you to create and visualize workflows with an interactive node-based UI. It's built using the powerful reactflow library and demonstrates concepts like:

1. Flowchart creation: Drag and drop nodes to represent different steps in your workflow.
2. Node customization: Design custom nodes with your preferred text content and appearance.
3. Connections: Connect nodes using edges to define the flow of your process.
4. Local storage: Save your workflows locally for future reference.
